### [The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#abop)

Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz, Aristid Lindenmayer

This book focuses on the graphical computer simulation of certain natural patterns. It uses Chomsky grammars to develop L-systems, with the same concept of replacing symbols according to some production rules.

- Things I noted from chapters 1 and 3:

    [Chapter 1 - Graphical modeling using L-systems](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch1.pdf)

    This constant satisfies a postulate by Leonardo da Vinci, according to which “all the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk below them.”

    **Umbel**

    An umbel is characterized by more than two internodes attached to a single node, resulting in a typical umbrella-like shape. In a simple umbel there are flowers at the ends of the lateral internodes (Figure 3.22a), while in compound umbels the branching pattern is repeated recursively a certain number of times (Figure 3.22b).

    This type of inflorescence is commonly found in the family Umbelliferae. For example, Figure 3.23 presents a model of a wild carrot. Note that Wild carrot the size of leaves decreases towards the top of the plant, producing a phase effect similar to that observed in simple racemes. In contrast, the most developed inflorescence is placed at the top of the plant, indicating developmental control by a hormone similar to that observed in mints (Figure 3.11).

    **Spike**
    An elongated raceme with closely packed flowers is called a spike. Many grasses and sedges have this kind of inflorescence (Figure 3.24a). See Figure 4.17 (page 117) for a realistic model.

    **Spadix**
    A fleshy elongated raceme is called a spadix, and is frequently found in the family Araceae (Figure 3.24b).

    **Capitulum**
    A fleshy spherical or disk-shaped raceme is called a capitulum or “head.” The sunflower head is an inflorescence of this kind, the oldest flowers being at the margin and the youngest at the center (Figure 3.24c). Members of the family Compositae commonly have this type of structure. One characteristic feature is the spatial arrangement of components, such as flowers or seeds, which form early discernible spiral patterns.

Read again the final [Chapter 8 - Fractal properties of plants](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch8.pdf), it talks about the Sierpìnski triangle.

### Che cosa raccontano le erbe infestanti

Ehrenfried E. Pfeiffer

**BOTANICA**

Libro del 1981 che fornisce consigli su come gestire in maniera casalinga le piante infestanti. Per quanto riguarda la Carota Selvatica, della famiglia delle ombrellifere, Pfeiffer dice che indica la presenza di un suolo fertile, proporzionalmente alla grandezza della pianta.

### Botany definitions and notions:

- In algorithmic information theory, the **Kolmogorov complexity** of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of a shortest computer program that produces the object as output.
- In mathematics, **topology** is concerned with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling and bending, but not tearing or gluing.
- **paràstico** agg. – In botanica, linee p., le linee immaginarie che, in uno schema fillotassico con numerosi fillomi per ogni ciclo, possono essere tracciate dal centro verso l’esterno congiungendo i fillomi contigui; le parastiche possono essere evidenziate anche nelle infruttescenze delle composite, per es. nel girasole, prendendo in considerazione i frutti contigui.
- **parastichy**; plural noun: **parastichie** (in phyllotaxis) an oblique row of leaves arranged in a secondary spiral.

[FILLOTASSI in "Enciclopedia Italiana"](http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/fillotassi_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/)

- Gerrit van Iterson, Dutch botanist and professor who developed a mathematical approach to plant growth (phyllotaxis), known for the **van Iterson diagram**
